        "description": "Data is collected because of public interest in how the City\u2019s budget is being spent on salary and overtime pay for all municipal employees. Data is input into the City's Personnel Management System (\u201cPMS\u201d) by the respective user Agencies. Each record represents the following statistics for every city employee: Agency, Last Name, First Name, Middle Initial, Agency Start Date, Work Location Borough, Job Title Description, Leave Status as of the close of the FY (June 30th), Base Salary, Pay Basis, Regular Hours Paid, Regular Gross Paid, Overtime Hours worked, Total Overtime Paid, and Total Other Compensation (i.e. lump sum and/or retro payments). This data can be used to analyze how the City's financial resources are allocated and how much of the City's budget is being devoted to overtime. The reader of this data should be aware that increments of salary increases received over the course of any one fiscal year will not be reflected. All that is captured, is the employee's final base and gross salary at the end of the fiscal year.  In very limited cases, a check replacement and subsequent refund may reflect both the original check as well as the re-issued check in employee pay totals.  \r\n<br>\r\n<b>NOTE 1: </b>To further improve the visibility into the number of employee OT hours worked, beginning with the FY 2023 report, an updated methodology will be used which will eliminate redundant reporting of OT hours in some specific instances.  In the previous calculation, hours associated with both overtime pay as well as an accompanying overtime \u201ccompanion code\u201d pay were included in the employee total even though they represented pay for the same period of time.  With the updated methodology, the dollars shown on the Open Data site will continue to be inclusive of both types of overtime, but the OT hours will now reflect a singular block of time, which will result in a more representative total of employee OT hours worked.   The updated methodology will primarily impact the OT hours associated with City employees in uniformed civil service titles.  The updated methodology will be applied to the Open Data posting for Fiscal Year 2023 and cannot be applied to prior postings and, as a result, the reader of this data should not compare OT <b>hours</b>  prior to the 2023 report against OT hours published starting Fiscal Year 2023.  The reader of this data may continue to compare OT <b>dollars</b> across all published Fiscal Years on Open Data. \r\n<br>\r\n<b>NOTE 2: </b>As a part of FISA-OPA\u2019s routine process for reviewing and releasing Citywide Payroll Data, data for some agencies (specifically NYC Police Department (NYPD) and the District Attorneys\u2019 Offices (Manhattan, Kings, Queens, Richmond, Bronx, and Special Narcotics)) have been redacted since they are exempt from disclosure pursuant to the Freedom of Information Law, POL \u00a7 87(2)(f), on the ground that disclosure of the information could endanger the life and safety of the public servants listed thereon. They are further exempt from disclosure pursuant to POL \u00a7 87(2)(e)(iii), on the ground that any release of the information would identify confidential sources or disclose confidential information relating to a criminal investigation, and POL \u00a7 87(2)(e)(iv), on the ground that disclosure would reveal non-routine criminal investigative techniques or procedures. Some of these redactions will appear as XXX in the name columns.",

        "description": "The Motor Vehicle Collisions crash table contains details on the crash event. Each row represents a crash event. The Motor Vehicle Collisions data tables contain information from all police reported motor vehicle collisions in NYC. The police report (MV104-AN) is required to be filled out for collisions where someone is injured or killed, or where there is at least $1000 worth of damage (https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.dot.gov/files/documents/ny_overlay_mv-104an_rev05_2004.pdf).  It should be noted that the data is preliminary and subject to change when the MV-104AN forms are amended based on revised crash details.For the most accurate, up to date statistics on traffic fatalities, please refer to the <a href=\"https://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/stats/traffic-data/traffic-data-collision.page\" style=\"color:#187bcd;\">NYPD Motor Vehicle Collisions page</a> (updated weekly) or <a href=\"http://www.nycvzv.info/\" style=\"color:#187bcd;\">Vision Zero View</a> (updated monthly).\r\n\r\n</p>\r\nDue to success of the CompStat program, NYPD began to ask how to apply the CompStat principles  to other problems.  Other than homicides, the fatal incidents with which police have the most contact with the public are fatal traffic collisions.  Therefore in April 1998, the Department implemented TrafficStat, which uses the CompStat model to work towards improving traffic safety.  Police officers complete form MV-104AN  for all vehicle collisions.  The MV-104AN is a New York State form that has all of the details of a traffic collision.  Before implementing Trafficstat, there was no uniform traffic safety data collection procedure for all of the NYPD precincts.  Therefore, the Police Department implemented the Traffic Accident Management System (TAMS) in July 1999 in order to collect traffic data in a uniform method across the City.  TAMS required the precincts manually enter a few selected MV-104AN fields to collect very basic intersection traffic crash statistics which included the number of accidents, injuries and fatalities. As the years progressed, there grew a need for additional traffic data so that more detailed analyses could be conducted. The Citywide traffic safety initiative, Vision Zero started in the year 2014.  Vision Zero further emphasized the need for the collection of more traffic data in order to work towards the Vision Zero goal, which is to eliminate traffic fatalities.  Therefore, the Department in March 2016 replaced the TAMS with the new Finest Online Records Management System (FORMS).  FORMS enables the police officers to electronically, using a Department cellphone or computer, enter all of the MV-104AN data fields and stores all of the MV-104AN data fields in the Department\u2019s crime data warehouse.  Since all of the MV-104AN data fields are now stored for each traffic collision, detailed traffic safety analyses can be conducted as applicable.",

Tree data collected includes tree species, diameter and perception of health. Accompanying blockface data is available indicating status of data collection and data release citywide.\n\nThe 2015 tree census was the third decadal street tree census and largest citizen science initiative in NYC Parks\u2019 history. Data collection ran from May 2015 to October 2016 and the results of the census show that there are 666,134 trees planted along NYC's streets. The data collected as part of the census represents a snapshot in time of trees under NYC Parks' jurisdiction.\n\nThe census data formed the basis of our operational database, the Forestry Management System (ForMS) which is used daily by our foresters and other staff for inventory and asset management: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/browse?sortBy=most_accessed&utf8=%E2%9C%93&Data-Collection_Data-Collection=Forestry+Management+System+%28ForMS%29\n\nTo learn more about the data collected and managed in ForMS, please refer to this user guide:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1PVPWFi-WExkG3rvnagQDoBbqfsGzxCKNmR6n678nUeU/edit.

Each violation is identified using a unique Violation ID. These Laws are in place to provide requirements for the maintenance of residential dwelling units within New York City. \r\nViolations are issued by Housing Inspectors after a physical inspection is conducted (except for class I violations which are generally  administratively issued).  Violations are issued in four classes: Class A (non-hazardous), Class B (hazardous), Class C (immediately hazardous) and Class I (information orders).  For more information on violations, see https://www1.nyc.gov/site/hpd/owners/compliance-clear-violations.page  \r\nThe base data for this file is all violations open as of October 1, 2012.  Violation data is updated daily.  The daily update includes both new violations and updates to the status of previously issued violations. An open violation is a violation which is still active on the Department records. See the status table for determining how to filter for open violations versus closed violations, and within open violations for a more detailed current status. \r\nThe property owner may or may not have corrected the physical condition if the status is open. The violation status is closed when the violation is observed/verified as corrected by HPD or as certified by the landlord.   The processes for having violations dismissed are described at http://www1.nyc.gov/site/hpd/owners/compliance-clear-violations.page\r\nUsing other HPD datasets, such as the Building File or the Registration File, a user can link together violations issued for given buildings or for given owners.",

The data in this table goes back to April 2016 when crash reporting switched to an electronic system.\r\n</p>\r\nThe Motor Vehicle Collisions data tables contain information from all police reported motor vehicle collisions in NYC. The police report (MV104-AN) is required to be filled out for collisions where someone is injured or killed, or where there is at least $1000 worth of damage (https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.dot.gov/files/documents/ny_overlay_mv-104an_rev05_2004.pdf).  It should be noted that the data is preliminary and subject to change when the MV-104AN forms are amended based on revised crash details.\r\n</p>\r\nDue to success of the CompStat program, NYPD began to ask how to apply the CompStat principles  to other problems.  Other than homicides, the fatal incidents with which police have the most contact with the public are fatal traffic collisions.  Therefore in April 1998, the Department implemented TrafficStat, which uses the CompStat model to work towards improving traffic safety.  Police officers complete form MV-104AN  for all vehicle collisions.  The MV-104AN is a New York State form that has all of the details of a traffic collision.  Before implementing Trafficstat, there was no uniform traffic safety data collection procedure for all of the NYPD precincts.  Therefore, the Police Department implemented the Traffic Accident Management System (TAMS) in July 1999 in order to collect traffic data in a uniform method across the City.  TAMS required the precincts manually enter a few selected MV-104AN fields to collect very basic intersection traffic crash statistics which included the number of accidents, injuries and fatalities. As the years progressed, there grew a need for additional traffic data so that more detailed analyses could be conducted. The Citywide traffic safety initiative, Vision Zero started in the year 2014.  Vision Zero further emphasized the need for the collection of more traffic data in order to work towards the Vision Zero goal, which is to eliminate traffic fatalities.  Therefore, the Department in March 2016 replaced the TAMS with the new Finest Online Records Management System (FORMS).  FORMS enables the police officers to electronically, using a Department cellphone or computer, enter all of the MV-104AN data fields and stores all of the MV-104AN data fields in the Department\u2019s crime data warehouse.  Since all of the MV-104AN data fields are now stored for each traffic collision, detailed traffic safety analyses can be conducted as applicable.",

Each row represents a person (driver, occupant, pedestrian, bicyclist,..) involved in a crash. The data in this table goes back to April 2016 when crash reporting switched to an electronic system.\r\n</p>\r\nThe Motor Vehicle Collisions data tables contain information from all police reported motor vehicle collisions in NYC. The police report (MV104-AN) is required to be filled out for collisions where someone is injured or killed, or where there is at least $1000 worth of damage (https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.dot.gov/files/documents/ny_overlay_mv-104an_rev05_2004.pdf).  It should be noted that the data is preliminary and subject to change when the MV-104AN forms are amended based on revised crash details.\r\n</p>\r\nDue to success of the CompStat program, NYPD began to ask how to apply the CompStat principles  to other problems.  Other than homicides, the fatal incidents with which police have the most contact with the public are fatal traffic collisions.  Therefore in April 1998, the Department implemented TrafficStat, which uses the CompStat model to work towards improving traffic safety.  Police officers complete form MV-104AN  for all vehicle collisions.  The MV-104AN is a New York State form that has all of the details of a traffic collision.  Before implementing Trafficstat, there was no uniform traffic safety data collection procedure for all of the NYPD precincts.  Therefore, the Police Department implemented the Traffic Accident Management System (TAMS) in July 1999 in order to collect traffic data in a uniform method across the City.  TAMS required the precincts manually enter a few selected MV-104AN fields to collect very basic intersection traffic crash statistics which included the number of accidents, injuries and fatalities. As the years progressed, there grew a need for additional traffic data so that more detailed analyses could be conducted. The Citywide traffic safety initiative, Vision Zero started in the year 2014.  Vision Zero further emphasized the need for the collection of more traffic data in order to work towards the Vision Zero goal, which is to eliminate traffic fatalities.  Therefore, the Department in March 2016 replaced the TAMS with the new Finest Online Records Management System (FORMS).

Charter schools are required to submit enrollment as of BEDS Day, the first Wednesday in October, to the New York State Department of Education.\"\nEnrollment counts in the Demographic Snapshot will likely exceed operational enrollment counts due to the fact that long-term absence (LTA) students are excluded for funding purposes.\nData on students with disabilities, English Language Learners, students' povery status, and students' Economic Need Value are as of the June 30 for each school year except in 2021-22. Data on SWDs, ELLs, Poverty, and ENI in the 2021-22 school year are as of March 7, 2022.\n3-K and Pre-K enrollment totals include students in both full-day and half-day programs. Four-year-old students enrolled in Family Childcare Centers are categorized as 3K students for the purposes of this report. \nAll schools listed are as of the 2021-22 school year. Schools closed before 2021-22 are not included in the school level tab but are included in the data for citywide, borough, and district. Programs and Pre-K NYC Early Education Centers (NYCEECs) are not included on the school-level tab.\nDue to missing demographic information in rare cases at the time of the enrollment snapshot, demographic categories do not always add up to citywide totals.\nStudents with disabilities are defined as any child receiving an Individualized Education Program (IEP) as of the end of the school year (or March 7 for 2021-22).\nNYC DOE \"Poverty\" counts are based on the number of students with families who have qualified for free or reduced price lunch, or are eligible for Human Resources Administration (HRA) benefits. In previous years, the poverty indicator also included students enrolled in a Universal Meal School (USM), where all students automatically qualified, with the exception of middle schools, D75 schools and Pre-K centers. In 2017-18, all students in NYC schools became eligible for free lunch. In order to better reflect free and reduced price lunch status, the poverty indicator does not include student USM status, and retroactively applies this rule to previous years. \n\"The school\u2019s Economic Need Index is the average of its students\u2019 Economic Need Values. The Economic Need Index (ENI) estimates the percentage of students facing economic hardship. The 2014-15 school year is the first year we provide ENI estimates. The metric is calculated as follows:\n   * The student\u2019s Economic Need Value is 1.0 if:\n         o The student is eligible for public assistance from the NYC Human Resources Administration (HRA);\n         o The student lived in temporary housing in the past four years; or\n         o The student is in high school, has a home language other than English, and entered the NYC DOE for the first time within the last four years.\n   * Otherwise, the student\u2019s Economic Need Value is based on the percentage of families (with school-age children) in the student\u2019s census tract whose income is below the poverty level, as estimated by the American Community Survey 5-Year estimate (2020 ACS estimates were used in calculations for 2021-22 ENI). The student\u2019s Economic Need Value equals this percentage divided by 100.\n\nDue to differences in the timing of when student demographic, address and census data were pulled, ENI values may vary, slightly, from the ENI values reported in the School Quality Reports.\n\nIn previous years, student census tract data was based on students\u2019 addresses at the time of ENI calculation. Beginning in 2018-19, census tract data is based on students\u2019 addresses as of the Audited Register date of the given school year. \n\nIn previous years, the most recent new entry date was used for students with multiple entry dates into the NYCDOE. Beginning in 2018-19, students\u2019 earliest entry date is used in ENI calculations.\n\nBeginning in 2018-19, students missing ENI data are imputed with the average ENI at their school.\n\"\nIn order to maintain student privacy,  schools with % Poverty and ENI values below 5% or above 95% have had their exact values for each category replaced with \"Below 5%\" and \"Above 95%\", respectively.\nBefore the start of the 2017-18 school year, the New York State Education Department implemented a new data matching process that refined the methods to identify families eligible for free lunch. This new matching system provides a more efficient and accurate process for matching students across a range of forms that families already complete. This new matching process yielded an increase in the number of students directly certified for free lunch (in other words, matched to another government program) and therefore increased the direct certification rate. As such, the increase in the percent of students in poverty and the Economic Need Index for the 2017-18 school year and later reflects this new matching process, which allows the City to better identify students eligible for free lunch.\nApproximately 25% of charter schools in NYC do not use NYC DOE School Food to provide meal services. The NYC DOE Office of School Food does not collect documentation on students\u2019 eligibility for Free or Reduced Price Lunch from schools that do not utilize NYC DOE School Food. As a result, the Poverty figures may be understated for approximately 25% of charter schools. \nNew York State Education Department begins administering assessments to be identified as an English Language Learner (ELL) in Kindergarten, but students in Pre-K are still included in the denominator for the ELL calculations. Also, Pre-K NYC Early Education Centers  do not use NYC DOE School Food to provide meal services, but are included in the denominator for Poverty calculations.",

Stores that have implemented all of the program\u2019s criteria at the conclusion of the Retail Challenge, and maintain them for at least one month, receive a recognition award from the Borough President's Office to acknowledge their efforts and dedication to make the healthy choice, the easier choice for their communities.\n\nThis is a manually compiled list of stores, which is based on data collected through implementation checklists; these are forms completed by Shop Healthy staff as part of store observations that track whether each criteria has been met.

DCWP's Office of Financial Empowerment (OFE) also developed NFH Indexes to present patterns in the data within and across neighborhoods. NFH Index scores describe relative differences between neighborhoods across the same indicators; they do not evaluate neighborhoods against fixed standards. OFE intends for the NFH Indexes to provide an easy reference tool for comparing neighborhoods, and to establish patterns in the relationship of NFH indicators to economic and demographic factors, such as race and income. Understanding these connections is potentially useful for uncovering systems that perpetuate the racial wealth gap, an issue with direct implications for OFE\u2019s mission to expand asset building opportunities for New Yorkers with low and moderate incomes. This data tool was borne out of the Collaborative for Neighborhood Financial Health, a community-led initiative designed to better understand how neighborhoods influence the financial health of their residents.",

DOHMH uses multiple methods including death certificates, vital records linkage, medical examiner records, and hospital discharge data to identify all pregnancy-associated deaths (deaths that occur during pregnancy or within a year of the end of pregnancy) of New York state residents in NYC each year. DOHMH convenes the Maternal Mortality and Morbidity Review Committee (M3RC), a multidisciplinary and diverse group of  40 members that conducts an in-depth, expert review of each pregnancy-associated death of New York state residents occurring in NYC from both clinical and social determinants of health perspectives. The data in this table come from vital records and the M3RC review process. Data are not cross-classified on all variables:  cause of death data are available by the relation to pregnancy (pregnancy-related, pregnancy-associated but not related, unable to determine), race/ethnicity and borough of residence data are each separately available for the total number of pregnancy-associated deaths and pregnancy-related deaths only.",

The data is collected in the New York Fire Incident Reporting System (NYFIRS), which is structured by the FDNY to provide data to the National Fire Incident Reporting System (NFIRS).  NFIRS is a modular all-incident reporting system designed by the U.S. Fire Administration. After responding to an incident, FDNY officers complete one or more of the NFIRS modules, depending upon the type of incident. The information in these modules describes the kind of incident responded to, where it occurred, the resources used to mitigate it.  Although NFIRS was designed specifically to understand the nature and causes of fire, as well as civilian fire casualties and firefighter injuries, it has been expanded to collect basic information on all incidents to which fire units respond.",

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s complete transformation of New York City\u2019s school system during the 2020-21 school year, and in accordance with New York State guidance, the 2021 ELA and Math assessments were optional for students to take. As a result, 21.6% of students in grades 3-8 took the English assessment in 2021 and 20.5% of students in grades 3-8 took the Math assessment. These participation rates are not representative of New York City students and schools and are not comparable to prior years, so results are not included in this report. \nDual Language enrollment includes English Language Learners and non-English Language Learners. \nDual Language data are based on data from STARS; as a result, school participation and student enrollment in Dual Language programs may differ from the data in this report. STARS course scheduling and grade management software applications provide a dynamic internal data system for school use; while standard course codes exist, data are not always consistent from school to school.\nThis report does not include enrollment at District 75 & 79 programs.

Year-to-year changes must have been at least 1 percentage point to qualify as \u201cMore Similar\u201d or \u201cLess Similar\u201d; changes less than 1 percentage point are categorized as \u201cNo Change\u201d. \nThe admissions method tab contains information on the admissions methods used for elementary, middle, and high school programs during the Fall 2020 admissions process. Fall 2020 selection criteria are included for all programs with academic screens, including middle and high school programs. Selection criteria data is based on school-reported information. Fall 2020 Diversity in Admissions priorities is included for applicable middle and high school programs. Note that the data on each school\u2019s demographics and performance includes all students of the given subgroup who were enrolled in the school on November 13, 2020. Some of these students may not have been admitted under the admissions method(s) shown, as some students may have enrolled in the school outside the centralized admissions process (via waitlist, over-the-counter, or transfer), and schools may have changed admissions methods over the past few years. Admissions methods are only reported for grades K-12.\n\"3K and Pre-Kindergarten data are reported at the site level. See below for definitions of site types included in this report.

Vulnerability contains three components: exposure to a hazard, susceptibility to harm from the exposure, and capacity to recover (Cutter et al., 2009). There are six hazard-specific FVIs, one for each of the six different flood hazard scenarios, which include current and two future storm surge scenarios and current and two future tidal flooding scenarios. Exposures vary for different types of flooding and different scenarios within each flood type. \n\nEach FVI consists of two component sub-indices: an exposure index and an index that reflects susceptibility to harm and capacity to recover. The exposure index is different in each FVI in order to capture the different exposures to each of the flood hazard scenarios. The sub-index that reflects susceptibility to harm and capacity to recover -- the Flood Susceptibility to Harm and Recovery Index (FSHRI) -- is the same for each FVI. It aggregates 12 socio-economic indicators correlated with various types of hardships that people may suffer due to flooding and different dimensions of ability to recover. \n\nFor additional information, please visit <a href=\"https://climate.cityofnewyork.us/initiatives/vulnerability-impacts-and-adaptation-analysis/\">this link</a>.",

        "name": "2016-17 - 2020-23 Citywide End-of-Year Attendance and Chronic Absenteeism Data",
        "description": "Overall attendance data include students in Districts 1-32 and 75 (Special Education). Students in District 79 (Alternative Schools & Programs), charter schools, home schooling, and home and hospital instruction are excluded. Pre-K data do not include NYC Early Education Centers or District Pre-K Centers; therefore, Pre-K data are limited to those who attend K-12 schools that offer Pre-K. Transfer schools are included in citywide, borough, and district counts but removed from school-level files.\nAttendance is attributed to the school the student attended at the time. If a student attends multiple schools in a school year, the student will contribute data towards multiple schools.\nStarting in 2020-21, the NYC DOE transitioned to NYSED's definition of chronic absenteeism. Students are considered chronically absent if they have an attendance of 90 percent or less (i.e. students who are absent 10 percent or more of the total days). In order to be included in chronic absenteeism calculations, students must be enrolled for at least 10 days (regardless of whether present or absent) and must have been present for at least 1 day. The NYSED chronic absenteeism definition is applied to all prior years in the report.\nSchool-level chronic absenteeism data reflect chronic absenteeism at a particular school. In order to eliminate double-counting students in chronic absenteeism counts, calculations at the district, borough, and citywide levels include all attendance data that contribute to the given geographic category. For example, if a student was chronically absent at one school but not at another, the student would only be counted once in the citywide calculation. For this reason, chronic absenteeism counts will not align across files.\nAll demographic data are based on a student's most recent record in a given year.\nStudents With Disabilities (SWD) data do not include Pre-K students since Pre-K students are screened for IEPs only at the parents' request.\nEnglish language learner (ELL) data do not include Pre-K students since the New York State Education Department only begins administering assessments to be identified as an ELL in Kindergarten.\nOnly grades PK-12 are shown, but calculations for \"All Grades\" also include students missing a grade level, so PK-12 may not add up to \"All Grades\". \nData include students missing a gender, but are not shown due to small cell counts.\nData for Asian students include Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islanders\u00a0. Multi-racial and Native American students, as well as students missing ethnicity/race data are included in the \"Other\" ethnicity category.\nIn order to comply with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) regulations on public reporting of education outcomes, rows with five or fewer students are suppressed, and have been replaced with an \"s\". Using total days of attendance as a proxy\u00a0, rows with 900 or fewer total days are suppressed. In addition, other rows have been replaced with an \"s\" when they could reveal, through addition or subtraction, the underlying numbers that have been redacted. Chronic absenteeism values are suppressed, regardless of total days, if the number of students who contribute\u00a0 at least 20 days is five or fewer.\u00a0\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting shift to remote learning in March 2020, 2019-20 attendance data was only available for September 2019 through March 13, 2020. Interactions data from the spring of 2020 are reported on a separate tab.\nInteractions were reported by schools during remote learning, from April 6 2020 through June 26 2020 (a total of 57 instructional days, excluding special professional development days of June 4 and June 9). Schools were required to indicate any student from their roster that did not have an interaction on a given day. Schools were able to define interactions in a way that made sense for their students and families. Definitions of an interaction included:\n\u2022 Student submission of an assignment or completion of an assessment, in whichever manner the school is collecting\n\u2022 Student participation in an online forum, chat log, or discussion thread\n\u2022 Student/family phone call, email or response to teacher email\n\u2022 Phone, email, and/or other digital communication with a family member which confirms student interaction/engagement\n\u2022 Other evidence of participation as determined by the principal.\nInteractions data are attributed to students' school of record on a given day. A student participating in a Shared Instruction (SHIN) model may have recorded interactions at multiple schools on a given day, but only one record is counted for the interaction rate, attributed to students' school of record for that day.\nDue to the shift to hybrid learning, attendance data for the 2020-21 school year include both in-person and remote instruction. Total days, days absent, and days present fields include both in-person and remote attendance.\nMore information on attendance policies can be found here: https://www.schools.nyc.gov/school-life/rules-for-students/attendance\u00a0",

OPT staff use a variety of systems to generate and share bus route information with bus vendors and the public. Specific bus route paths cannot be publicly disclosed because they could reveal personally identifiable information about individual students. In this dataset, OPT has provided all the route information that does not risk disclosing personally identifiable information. \r\nSchool-age service for students in grades K through 12 are contracted with bus vendors on a per route basis. OPT also manages bus service for Pre-K students who require curb-to-curb service as per a student\u2019s Individualized Education Plan (IEP). This Pre-K bus service is contracted on a per student basis, instead of per route. As a consequence of this difference, OPT does not design bus routes for Pre-K service, so those routes are not included in this dataset.\r\nThere are a variety of different vehicles used on routes that serve students requiring curb-to-curb service because an Individualized Education Plan (IEP) indicates specific transportation needs. The standard bus is the only vehicle used for general education routes with students eligible for bus service but who do not have an IEP.\r\nUsers may occasionally see a route without a garage assignment. Because this dataset is derived from a snapshot of a transactional system, there may be routes that are in the process of being assigned to a garage. In those cases, the garage information will appear as NULL until the assignment is complete.",

        "description": "In 2016 NYC Parks contracted with the UVM Spatial Analysis Lab to use modern remote sensing and object-based image analysis to create a new wetlands map for New York City. Data inputs include Light Detection and Ranging Data, State and Federal Wetland Inventories, soils, and field data. Because the map was conservative in its wetlands predictions, NYC Parks staff improved the map through a series of desktop and field verification efforts. From June to November 2020, NYC Parks staff field verified the majority of wetlands on NYC Parks' property. \n\nThe map will be opportunistically updated depending on available field information and delineations. Another dedicated field verification effort has not been planned. As of June 2021, no subsequent updates to the data are scheduled. \n\nOriginal field names were updated to field names that are easier to understand. \n\nThis dataset was developed to increase awareness regarding the location and extent of wetlands to promote restoration and conservation in New York City. This map does not supersede U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) and New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) wetlands maps and has no jurisdictional authority. It should be used alongside NWI and NYSDEC datasets as a resource for identifying likely locations of wetlands in New York City. Mapped features vary in the confidence of their verification status, ranging from \"Unverified\" (meaning the feature exists in its original remotely mapped form and has not been ground truthed) to \"Verified - Wetland Delineation\" (meaning the boundaries and type of wetland have been verified during an official wetland delineation). Because of the rapid nature of the protocol and the scale of data collection, this product is not a subsitute for on-site investigations and field delineations. The dataset also includes broad classifications for each wetland type, e.g. estuarine, emergent wetland, forested wetland, shrub/scrub wetland, or water. Cowardin classifcations were not used given rapid verfication methods. \n\nThe accuracy of the wetlands map has improved over time as a result of the verification process. Fields were added over time as necessitated by the workflow and values were updated with information, either from the field verifications, delineation reports, or desktop analysis. \n\nOBJECTID, Shape, Class_Name_Final, Verification_Status, Create_Date, Last_Edited_Date, Verification_Status_Year, SHAPE_Length, SHAPE_Area\n\nhttps://www.nycgovparks.org/greening/natural-resources-group\n\nData Dictionary:\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1a45qCho45MV-AuOlGxyaRp0cg3cRFKw4lAYBIaU3zi4/edit#gid=260500519\n\nMap:\nhttps://data.cityofnewyork.us/dataset/NYC-Wetlands/7piy-bhr9",

        "description": "Overall attendance data include students in Districts 1-32 and 75 (Special Education). Students in District 79 (Alternative Schools & Programs), charter schools, home schooling, and home and hospital instruction are excluded. Pre-K data do not include NYC Early Education Centers or District Pre-K Centers; therefore, Pre-K data are limited to those who attend K-12 schools that offer Pre-K. Transfer schools are included in citywide, borough, and district counts but removed from school-level files.\nAttendance is attributed to the school the student attended at the time. If a student attends multiple schools in a school year, the student will contribute data towards multiple schools.\nStarting in 2020-21, the NYC DOE transitioned to NYSED's definition of chronic absenteeism. Students are considered chronically absent if they have an attendance of 90 percent or less (i.e. students who are absent 10 percent or more of the total days). In order to be included in chronic absenteeism calculations, students must be enrolled for at least 10 days (regardless of whether present or absent) and must have been present for at least 1 day. The NYSED chronic absenteeism definition is applied to all prior years in the report.\nSchool-level chronic absenteeism data reflect chronic absenteeism at a particular school. In order to eliminate double-counting students in chronic absenteeism counts, calculations at the district, borough, and citywide levels include all attendance data that contribute to the given geographic category. For example, if a student was chronically absent at one school but not at another, the student would only be counted once in the citywide calculation. For this reason, chronic absenteeism counts will not align across files.\nAll demographic data are based on a student's most recent record in a given year.\nStudents With Disabilities (SWD) data do not include Pre-K students since Pre-K students are screened for IEPs only at the parents' request.\nEnglish language learner (ELL) data do not include Pre-K students since the New York State Education Department only begins administering assessments to be identified as an ELL in Kindergarten.\nOnly grades PK-12 are shown, but calculations for \"All Grades\" also include students missing a grade level, so PK-12 may not add up to \"All Grades\". \nData include students missing a gender, but are not shown due to small cell counts.\nData for Asian students include Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islanders\u00a0. Multi-racial and Native American students, as well as students missing ethnicity/race data are included in the \"Other\" ethnicity category.\nIn order to comply with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) regulations on public reporting of education outcomes, rows with five or fewer students are suppressed, and have been replaced with an \"s\". Using total days of attendance as a proxy\u00a0, rows with 900 or fewer total days are suppressed. In addition, other rows have been replaced with an \"s\" when they could reveal, through addition or subtraction, the underlying numbers that have been redacted. Chronic absenteeism values are suppressed, regardless of total days, if the number of students who contribute\u00a0 at least 20 days is five or fewer.\u00a0\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting shift to remote learning in March 2020, 2019-20 attendance data was only available for September 2019 through March 13, 2020. Interactions data from the spring of 2020 are reported on a separate tab.\nInteractions were reported by schools during remote learning, from April 6 2020 through June 26 2020 (a total of 57 instructional days, excluding special professional development days of June 4 and June 9). Schools were required to indicate any student from their roster that did not have an interaction on a given day. Schools were able to define interactions in a way that made sense for their students and families. Definitions of an interaction included:\n\u2022 Student submission of an assignment or completion of an assessment, in whichever manner the school is collecting\n\u2022 Student participation in an online forum, chat log, or discussion thread\n\u2022 Student/family phone call, email or response to teacher email\n\u2022 Phone, email, and/or other digital communication with a family member which confirms student interaction/engagement\n\u2022 Other evidence of participation as determined by the principal.\nInteractions data are attributed to students' school of record on a given day. A student participating in a Shared Instruction (SHIN) model may have recorded interactions at multiple schools on a given day, but only one record is counted for the interaction rate, attributed to students' school of record for that day.\nDue to the shift to hybrid learning, attendance data for the 2020-21 school year include both in-person and remote instruction. Total days, days absent, and days present fields include both in-person and remote attendance.\n\nMore information on attendance policies can be found here: https://www.schools.nyc.gov/school-life/rules-for-students/attendance\u00a0",

The data includes counts of the number of intimate-partner felony assaults and the number of expected intimate-partner felony assaults by: race (American Indian, Asian, Black, Hispanic and White) and sex (male, female) for New York City, each borough (Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens and Staten Island) and community district. The following defines felony assault: Felony assault requires that a victim suffer a physical injury and covers injuries caused either intentionally or recklessly and includes injuries caused by either a deadly weapon or dangerous instrument. See New York Penal Law \u00a7 \u00a7 120.05, 120.10. The expected number of felony assaults were calculated by taking the total number of actual felony assaults for a given geography (New York City, the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens and Staten Island) and proportioning them by demographic breakdown of the geographic area.",

The dataset contains records for each individual, scenic, or interior landmark, as well as properties or sites located within the boundaries of historic districts. Please note that points in this dataset represent individual buildings in addition to non-building sites (such as vacant lots or monuments) regulated by LPC. It is possible for a single property to have multiple designations (such as individual and interior designations, or individual and historic district). For this reason, it is not uncommon to see multiple points on a single tax lot and multiple records for a single property within the database. Please pay close attention to the \"MOST_CURRENT,\" \"BBL_STATUS and \"LAST_ACTION_ON_LP\" fields, which together denote the designation status of a site/property (see Attribute Definitions for more information). The geographic locations of the points in this dataset are derived primarily from the Department of City Planning's PLUTO data in combination with the Department of Information Technology & Telecommunication's building footprint information. Because this dataset is not automatically updated when changes occur in the underlying dataset, BIN numbers and tax lot information are potentially out of date.

GBV can include intimate partner and family violence, elder abuse, sexual assault, stalking, and human trafficking. ENDGBV operates the New York City Family Justice Centers. These co\u2010located multidisciplinary domestic violence service centers provide vital social service, civil legal and criminal justice assistance for survivors of intimate partner violence and their children under one roof. The Brooklyn Family Justice Center opened in July 2005; the Queens Family Justice Center opened in July 2008; the Bronx Family Justice Center opened in April 2010; Manhattan Family Justice Center opened in December 2013 and Staten Island Family Justice Center opened in June 2015. OCDV also has a Policy and Training Institute that provides trainings on intimate partner violence to other City agencies. The New York City Healthy Relationship Academy, with is part of the Policy and Training Institute, provides peer lead workshops on healthy relationships and teen dating violence to individuals between the age of 13 and 24, their parents and staff of agencies that work with youth in that age range.  The dataset is collected to produce an annual fact sheet on intimate partner violence in New York City. The fact sheet is produced annually by the end of February and is placed on the ENDGBV website. The criminal justice numbers (IPV Homicides, DIRs) are provided by the New York City Police Department; the NYC Domestic Violence Hotline call numbers are provided by Safe Horizon, which is contracted by the City to manage the hotline.

Speed humps are 3\u20134 inches high and 14\u201320 feet wide, with a ramp length of 3\u20136 feet, depending on target speed. Speed cushions are either speed humps or speed tables that include wheel cutouts to allow large vehicles to pass unaffected, while reducing passenger car speeds. They can be offset to allow unimpeded passage by emergency vehicles and are typically used on key emergency response routes. Speed humps are generally installed on local residential (non-truck route, non-bus route locations), while speed cushions are generally installed on designated truck route locations and bus route locations.\r\n\r\nThe requests for speed hump/cushion come through Commissioner Correspondences or from other sources and entered manually into the Speed Reducer Tracking System. The Speed Reducer Tracking System then tracks the results of request to determine whether a speed hump/cushion is feasible for installation.",

These areas may include plazas, beaches, walking paths, as well as features that contribute to the overall use of public open spaces, such as bathroom and maintenance structures, parking lots, and cultural institutions. While these latter features are not defined as 'passive' in the 2021 CEQR Open Space chapter, they will be included in the forthcoming updated version of the chapter.\n\nThis dataset is intended for use in completing an Open Space analysis as part of the City Environmental Quality Review (CEQR) process only. Please fully read the Data Dictionary linked below before using this dataset to complete a CEQR Open Space analysis. Additional research may be necessary to identify other open space resources within a given study area, including those managed by federal, state, and city agencies, as well as private entities.

In many neighborhoods, these DOE schoolyards are one of the few resources that can be improved and provide publicly accessible open space.\n \nEach record in this dataset represents a participating DOE Schoolyard at the time of the dataset's publication. The schoolyard's boundaries have been drawn in whole or part using secondary data. Data accuracy is limited by the scale and accuracy of the original sources. Site-specific conditions should be field-verified. \n \n For more information on the Schoolyard to Playgrounds program, visit: https://www.nycgovparks.org/greening/planyc/schoolyards\n \nThis dataset may be updated throughout the year as school's join or exit the program.\n\nData Dictionary: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10yVRhmdIAS1g8c3L0jC4XxSTptdIf5wESL5ks1e6Gto/edit?usp=sharing",

A majority vote is required for passage.</br>\n<strong>Mayoral Action</strong> \u2013 Once passed by the Council, the bill is sent to the Mayor, who may sign it into law, veto it, or allow it to become law without a signature. If vetoed, the Council can override the veto with a two-thirds majority vote.</br>\n<strong>Enactment</strong> \u2013 Once signed or passed via override, the bill is assigned a local law number and becomes part of the city\u2019s legal code.

Therefore, students who are routed are assumed to be enrolled in blended learning.\nStudents are reported as those who were planned and routed, but may or may not have used the service provided.\nRoutes were determined by those routed with a vendor and student(s) assigned\nVehicles are identified by school bus company reported data. This data is subject to data entry error and is dependent on the school bus companies to maintain.\nAll transportation sites were included, and reported by type. A transportation site was defined by a unique location identified by a street address. Please note: multiple students or schools can be located in the same address and would therefore represent a stop for multiple students at the same site.\nMetroCard passes are assigned at the school. For public and charter schools, OPT reports students assigned to MetroCard, which includes those assigned a MetroCard by serial number or \"T'd\" for MetroCard, meaning the school indicated the student as eligible for a MetroCard but did not yet assign a serial number. For Non-Public schools, OPT reports on students who are eligible for MetoCards if they are not assigned to yellow bus service\nSome special education schools do not classify students by grade level. Students attending such schools are identified as \u201cNG.\u201d\nService type is representative only of the type of busing a student is assigned to and is not reflective of the educational classification of a student. Students who are classified as special education but do not have an IEP mandate for specific transportation accommodations may be assigned to general education busing. General education students under certain circumstances including, but not limited to temporary housing status, orders of protection and medical conditions may be assigned to special education busing.\nOPT assigns students to busing but cannot confirm student ridership. This reporting would have to be captured at the school level.\nStudents in temporary housing (STH) situations other than those reported to be living in a DHS shelter* were excluded from the report due to data quality issues. While the DOE student data system (ATS) has a housing indicator flag, it is often inaccurate and unreliable. Therefore, OPT cannot reliably report on the temporary housing status of students other than those residing in DHS shelters, where a daily report indicating shelter status is provided. \n*Transportation data for students in Foster Care is also provided. Please see section 21-993 B7 for reporting.\nStop to school bus service is typically not provided to students after the 6th grade. Those assigned to this service are students who are granted individual or school-wide exceptions.\nIn addition to students who applied for transportation because of foster care placement, also reported were students known to be in foster care who received busing or A MetroCard to provide a more complete report of students in foster care who received service.\nStudents in foster care were identified by a monthly data feed from ACS to OPT via DIIT.

Each row is a different \"Initiative Detailed\", which is IBO's understanding of the purpose of the funding. IBO developed seven categories of initiative to standardize the comparison of budgeted and spent amounts across agencies: \"Initiative Category\". The IBO definitions of these categories are below, in order of prioritization (e.g. if a budget code fits the definition of 2. COVID Response \u2013 Public Programs and 4. Programmatic Support, it is listed under 2). If readers require more detailed information on spending, the underlying data with the previous initiative names is available for download. \r\n\r\n1.\tCovid Response \u2013 City Operations: Spending to keep city agencies operating during the Covid pandemic, such as city employee leave for quarantining and vaccinations, air purifiers, personal protective equipment (PPE) for city employees, etc.\r\n2.\tCovid Response \u2013 Public Programs: Programs created to protect people in New York City from Covid-19.\r\n3.\tDirect Human Services: Public services provided to meet the financial, physical, or mental needs of New York City residents. This includes ongoing services for housing, food, addiction treatment, childcare, education, anti-poverty, etc. These services are either provided by the government or a nonprofit.\r\n4.\tProgrammatic Support: Funds used on temporary governmental programs. Note: this includes youth training and summer work programs because they are optional and extra-curricular, while public education and adult job training programs are direct human services.\r\n5.\tGovernment Operations: Federal funding supplemented lost revenue during the pandemic-related recession. These funds are for Other than Personal Spending, those administrative costs or public services provided in perpetuity (as opposed to services defined as Programmatic Support). \r\n6.\tPersonnel/Staffing: Federal funding supplemented lost revenue during the pandemic-related recession. These funds are for salaries and wages paid to city employees, often called \u201cPersonal Services.\u201d Salaries and wages related to Covid response, temporary programs, and direct human services are excluded from this category.\r\n7.\tHiring & Attrition Management: Administrative costs related to managing the inflow and outflow of city employees.",

The 2000\u20132002 CAFRs show outstanding general obligation debt, before Treasury Obligations, in 2000 and 2001 as $26,892 million and $26,836 million, respectively. However, CAFRs from 2003 on show higher GO debt for the two years, $353 million more for 2000 and $311 million more for 2001; the 2003 CAFR does not provide a note explaining the revisions. IBO uses the numbers reported from 2003 forward.\r\n3Fiscal years 2000, 2002, and 2003 include short-term bond anticipation notes outstanding at year-end of $515 million, $2.2 billion, and $1.1 billion, respectively.\r\n4For fiscal year 2000, Capital Lease Obligations to HHC and PCDC are reported jointly. \r\n5In FY 2008, JSDC bonds outstanding were redeemed with GO bond proceeds, resulting in the elimination of JSDC debt, a reduction in conduit debt outstanding and partially accounting for the increase in GO debt from 2007 to 2008\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nGeneral Obligation:\r\nGeneral obligation bonds are backed by the full faith and credit of the city.

They are netted out in order to avoid double counting of the city's obligations.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nTransitional Finance Authority:\r\nCreated in 1997, the Transitional Finance Authority (TFA) is a separate legal entity from the City of New York. TFA General Purpose Bonds are secured by the city's collections of personal income tax and, if necessary, sales tax.  Recovery Bonds, issued in response to the events of September 11, 2001 differ from general purpose bonds in that they are excluded from the calculation of outstanding TFA debt allowed under the debt limit.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nTFA Building Aid Revenue Bonds:\r\nIn fiscal year 2006, the city was authorized by the state Legislature to assign to the TFA all or any portion of the state building aid payable to the city or its school district. The TFA in turn is authorized to issue bonds secured by the aid and dedicated to financing a portion of the city's educational facilities capital plan.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nTSASC:\r\nTSASC Inc. (formerly known as the Tobacco Settlement Asset Securitization Corporation) is a separate legal entity from the City of New York. TSASC bonds are secured by the corporation's purchase from the city of the future revenue stream under a settlement agreement resolving cigarette smoking-related litigation between the settling states and participating manufacturers.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nMunicipal Assistance Corporation for the City of New York:\r\nThe Municipal Assistance Corporation (MAC) was a separate legal entity from the City of New York, created in 1975 and formally dissolved in 2008. With New York City experiencing a severe fiscal crisis in 1975, MAC allowed the city continued access to credit markets and assisted in the prevention of a default of city general obligation bonds. MAC bonds were secured by state collections of certain sales and compensating use taxes (imposed by the state within the city at rates formerly imposed by the city), the stock transfer tax, and certain per capita state aid.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nSamurai Funding Corporation:\r\nThe Samurai Funding Corporation (SFC) was a separate legal entity from the City of New York, which issued Japanese yen-denominated bonds. The yen-denominated bonds were secured by the proceeds of New York City general obligation bonds held by SFC.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nConduit Debt:\r\nThe city makes annual appropriations from its general fund for agreements with other entities that issue debt to build or maintain facilities on behalf of the city. These agreements are known as \"leaseback\" transactions, where the city makes rental payments to the partner entity in an amount sufficient to pay the entity's debt service on the securities issued for the respective capital expenditures. These entities, though legally separate from the city, either provide services exclusively to the city, have governance boards whose majority is appointed by the city, or are otherwise subject to the city's imposition of its will on the activities of the entity.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nExcluded Items:\r\nIBO considered several other items for inclusion as outstanding debt of the City of New York that were ultimately determined not to constitute obligations of the city, including: outstanding bonds of the Fiscal Year 2005 Securitization Corporation (FSC), outstanding bonds of the Sales Tax Asset Receivable Corporation (STAR), notes of the Hudson Yards Infrastructure Corporation (HYIC), and general capital lease obligations.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nFSC is a financing instrumentality of the city, formed for the purpose of issuing bonds, the proceeds of which were used to acquire securities, held in escrow, which economically defeased city general obligation bonds. As the general obligation bonds in question are included in the calculation of outstanding general obligation debt, the inclusion of the FSC bonds as well would constitute a double counting. As such, IBO does not count FSC debt outstanding toward total New York City debt outstanding.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nSTAR is a financing instrumentality of the city, formed for the purpose of issuing bonds, the proceeds of which were used to assume the remaining obligations of MAC. STAR pays the debt service on these bonds with revenues received from the Local Government Assistance Corporation, a state entity whose revenues are 1 percent of the statewide sales tax. The debt of STAR is not an obligation of the city, and the revenues used to pay STAR debt service would not accrue to the city in the corporation's absence. As such, IBO does not count STAR debt outstanding toward total New York City debt outstanding.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nHYIC entered into an agreement with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) to purchase from the MTA Transferrable Development Rights.  $200 million of notes were issued by HYIC, the proceeds of which were used to execute the transaction. Debt service on the notes was paid from the proceeds of the bonds issued by HYIC which are included in IBO's definition of outstanding debt under conduit debt.  Therefore, inclusion in outstanding debt of the notes in addition to the bonds would constitute a double counting. As such, IBO does not count HYIC notes outstanding toward total New York City debt outstanding.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nIn addition to the capital leases deemed to be debt obligations of the city under conduit debt, various city agencies have entered into leases that have been determined under generally accepted accounting practices to be capital leases. Unlike issuers of conduit debt, the lessors of these general lease obligations do not exist to provide services exclusively to the city, do not have boards the majority of whose members are appointed by the city, or are not otherwise subject to the city's imposition of its will on their activities. These general capital lease obligations do not constitute an obligation of the city toward any bonds or other borrowing. As such, IBO does not count general capital lease obligations toward total New York City debt outstanding.\r\n.",

The pilot also tested PAMARES model air quality improvement devices from StaticAir (https://www.staticair.com) to assess their effectiveness in reducing particulate matter in targeted areas. By combining continuous monitoring with physical air quality interventions, the initiative aimed to determine both the reliability of the sensor technology and the measurable impact of the air purification devices in urban settings.",

        "name": "DOHMH COVID-19 Antibody-by-Modified ZIP Code Tabulation Area",
        "description": "This dataset contains information on antibody testing for COVID-19: the number of people who received a test, the number of people with positive results, the percentage of people tested who tested positive, and the rate of testing per 100,000 people,  stratified by modified ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) of residence. Modified ZCTA reflects the first non-missing address within NYC for each person reported with an antibody test result. This unit of geography is similar to ZIP codes but combines census blocks with smaller populations to allow more stable estimates of population size for rate calculation. It can be challenging to map data that are reported by ZIP Code. A ZIP Code doesn\u2019t refer to an area, but rather a collection of points that make up a mail delivery route. Furthermore, there are some buildings that have their own ZIP Code, and some non-residential areas with ZIP Codes. To deal with the challenges of ZIP Codes, the Health Department uses ZCTAs which solidify ZIP codes into units of area. Often, data reported by ZIP code are actually mapped by ZCTA. The ZCTA geography was developed by the U.S. Census Bureau. These data can also be accessed here: https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data/blob/master/totals/antibody-by-modzcta.csv  Exposure to COVID-19 can be detected by measuring antibodies to the disease in a person\u2019s blood, which can indicate that a person may have had an immune response to the virus. Antibodies are proteins produced by the body\u2019s immune system that can be found in the blood. People can test positive for antibodies after they have been exposed, sometimes when they no longer test positive for the virus itself. It is important to note that the science around COVID-19 antibody tests is evolving rapidly and there is still much uncertainty about what individual antibody test results mean for a single person and what population-level antibody test results mean for understanding the epidemiology of COVID-19 at a population level.\n</br>\nThese data only provide information on people tested. People receiving an antibody test do not reflect all people in New York City;  therefore, these data may not reflect antibody prevalence among all New Yorkers. Increasing instances of screening programs further impact the generalizability of these data, as screening programs influence who and how many people are tested over time. Examples of screening programs in NYC include: employers screening their workers (e.g., hospitals), and long-term care facilities screening their residents.\n\nIn addition, there may be potential biases toward people receiving an antibody test who have a positive result because people who were previously ill are preferentially seeking testing, in addition to the testing of persons with higher exposure (e.g., health care workers, first responders)\n\nRates were calculated using interpolated intercensal population estimates updated in 2019. These rates differ from previously reported rates based on the 2000 Census or previous versions of population estimates. The Health Department produced these population estimates based on estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau and NYC Department of City Planning. \n\nAntibody tests are categorized based on the date of specimen collection and are aggregated by full weeks starting each Sunday and ending on Saturday. For example, a person whose blood was collected for antibody testing on Wednesday, May 6 would be categorized as tested during the week ending May 9. A person tested twice in one week would only be counted once in that week. This dataset includes testing data beginning April 5, 2020.\n\nData are updated daily, and the dataset preserves historical records and source data changes, so each extract date reflects the current copy of the data as of that date. For example, an extract date of 11/04/2020 and extract date of 11/03/2020 will both contain all records as they were as of that extract date. Without filtering or grouping by extract date, an analysis will almost certainly be miscalculating or counting the same values multiple times. To analyze the most current data, only use the latest extract date. Antibody tests that are missing dates are not included in the dataset; as dates are identified, these events are added.   Lags between occurrence and report of cases and tests can be assessed by comparing counts and rates across multiple data extract dates.\n</br>\nFor further details, visit:\n\u2022\thttps://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page\n\u2022\thttps://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data\n\u2022\thttps://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/Modified-Zip-Code-Tabulation-Areas-MODZCTA-/pri4-ifjk",

The Digital City Map (DCM) is comprised of seven datasets; Digital City Map, Street Center Line, City Map Alterations, Arterial Highways and Major Streets, Street Name Changes (areas), Street Name Changes (lines), and Street Name Changes (points).\r\n\r\nAll of the Digital City Map (DCM) datasets are featured on the <a href=\"https://streets.planning.nyc.gov/about\">Streets App</a>\r\n\r\nAll previously released versions of this data are available at BYTES of the <a href=\"https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/bytes-archive.page?sorts[year]=0\">BIG APPLE- Archive </a>\r\n\r\nUpdates for this dataset, along with other multilayered maps on NYC Open Data, are temporarily paused while they are moved to a new mapping format. Please visit https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/dwn-digital-city-map.page to utilize this data in the meantime.",

        "description": "The Walk to a Park initiative focuses on increasing access to parks and open spaces, concentrating on areas of the city that are under-resourced and where residents are living further than a walk to a park. NYC Parks calculates the number of New Yorkers within walking distance of a park and reports on this as part of the Mayor\u2019s Management Report. \u201cWalking distance\u201d is defined as a 1/4-mile or less for sites such as small playgrounds and sitting areas; or a 1/2-mile or less for larger parks that serve a wider region, typically over 8 acres or situated on the waterfront. Certain properties in NYC Parks' portfolio, such as cemeteries, community gardens, or sites with no recreational equipment were not included in this analysis. Similarly, some parks and open-space amenities not under the jurisdiction of NYC Parks were included in this analysis, as they provide recreational value.\r\n\r\nThis dataset includes two ESRI shapefiles of access points, one for sites that get a 1/4-mile buffer and one for sites that get a 1/2-mile buffer. It also includes an ESRI shapefile of the combined polygon that is the output of this analysis. This polygon represents the total area within walking distance of a park. To generate the number of New Yorkers within that distance, the polygon is compared with data from the U.S. Census.\r\n\r\nThis information is only current as of the publication date.

Pre-K data do not include NYC Early Education Centers; therefore, Pre-K data are limited to those who attend K-12 schools that offer Pre-K and District Pre-K Centers.\nThis spreadsheet reports attendance rates (overall and remote) for September 13 through September 30, 2021. Data comprises attendance records for those dates reported by schools in ATS as of October 28, 2021.\nOverall Attendance Rate is defined as the percent of days where students have present attendance status, out of total days with reported attendance data, across 13 days of attendance data September 13-30. Remote Instruction Attendance Rate* is defined as the percent of days where students have present remote attendance status out of total days with a remote attendance record reported, across 13 days of attendance data.

Data for Asian students include Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islanders.\nStudents in temporary housing (STH) include all students who lack a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence as defined by Section 725 of the McKinney-Vento Act. It includes students who are identified as \"doubled up\" (sharing the housing of others due to economic hardship), or living in some other unstable, temporary housing. It does not include students who are identified as residing in shelters.\nIn order to comply with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) regulations on public reporting of education outcomes, subgroups with fewer than 5 students are suppressed and have been replaced with an \"s\".\nInstances where there are no reported attendance data have been marked with an \"NA\".\n*Remote Instruction Attendance Rate includes students receiving Medically Necessary Instruction (MNI), students receiving remote instruction while quarantining, and system-wide remote learning days.",

Driving at or below 25 MPH decreases stopping distance, gives drivers and pedestrians more time to see each other and react, and improves drivers\u2019 ability to avoid crashes. Pedestrians struck by vehicles traveling at 25 MPH are half as likely to die as those struck at 30 MPH. If crashes do occur, the severity of injuries is reduced a lower speeds.

In addition to the numbers of students earning Advanced Regents Designation on their diplomas, another metric was developed based on performance on Math and ELA Regents exams. The Math/ELA APM represents the percentage of students in the cohort who graduated with any regular diploma (Regents Diploma with Advanced Designation, Regents Diploma, or Local Diploma) and who scored 80 or greater on their highest mathematics Regents and 75 or greater on the English Regents. Since this metric is new for the Class of 2010, only one year of results is reported, separately for June and August graduation cohorts.

        "description": "For schools with students in any grades between Kindergarten and 9th grade (where 9th grade is the termination grade for the school), class size is reported by four program areas: general education, special education self-contained class, collaborative team teaching and gifted and talented self-contained class. Within each program area class size is reported by grade or service category, which indicates how a special education self-contained class is delivered. Class size is calculated by dividing the number of students in a program and grade by the number of official classes in that program and grade.\n\nThe following data is excluded from all the reports: District 75 schools, bridge classes which span more than one grade, classes with fewer than five students (for other than special education self-contained classes) and classes with one student (for special education self-contained classes). On the summary reports programs and grades with three or fewer classes are excluded from the citywide, borough and region reports and programs and grades with one class are excluded from the district report. For schools with students in any grades between 9th and 12th grade (where 9th grade is not the termination grade for the school), class size is reported by two program areas: general education and special education. For general education students class size is reported by grade for each core subject area: English, Math, Science and Social Studies. For special education students with a self-contained program recommendation, class size is reported by service category (self-contained or mainstream) for each core subject area. Since high school classes may contain students in multiple grades and programs, class size is calculated by taking a weighted average of all the classes in a core subject area with students in a particular grade or program. For example, there are 75 ninth graders enrolled at a high school. 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 28 students, a second group of 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 25 students, and a third group of 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 30 students. Average class size for ninth grade Math equals: (25x28 + 25x25 + 25x30)/75 = 27.7.\n\nThe Pupil Teacher Ratio is also provided on the school level report. Pupil Teacher Ratio is another means to evaluate the instructional resources provided at a school. Pupil Teacher Ratio for All Students is calculated by dividing the number of students at a school by the number of full-time equivalent teachers, including both teachers in classes taught by two teachers, \u201ccluster\u201d teachers providing instruction in specialized topics like art or science, and teachers providing special education instruction. Pupil Teacher Ratio Excluding Special Education is calculated by dividing the number of non-special education students at a school by the number of full-time equivalent non-special education teachers.",

The New York City Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) treats the solid component of the City\u2019s wastewater using anaerobic digestion. This biological process produces biosolids, which can be used as fertilizer, and biogas, a renewable energy source.\n\nCo-digestion is the process of digesting food scraps alongside sewage sludge. The biogas generated is used on-site in boilers to heat the digesters and provide space heating. Excess biogas undergoes biogas-to-grid treatment, where it is purified and upgraded to renewable natural gas (RNG). Following purification, the RNG is exported to the natural gas pipeline as a direct replacement to fossil fuels. Excess biogas is flared during temporary system outages of the biogas cleaning system due to maintenance, operational constraints, or emergency events.\n\nThe co-digestion and biogas-to-grid program provides a local recycling outlet for food scraps, transforming waste into renewable energy. Together, they reduce greenhouse gas emissions by replacing a portion of fossil natural gas with RNG and avoiding the methane emissions that would occur if the food scraps were disposed of in a landfill.

        "name": "2016-17 - 2020-21 District End-of-Year Attendance and Chronic Absenteeism Data",
        "description": "Overall attendance data include students in Districts 1-32 and 75 (Special Education). Students in District 79 (Alternative Schools & Programs), charter schools, home schooling, and home and hospital instruction are excluded. Pre-K data do not include NYC Early Education Centers or District Pre-K Centers; therefore, Pre-K data are limited to those who attend K-12 schools that offer Pre-K. Transfer schools are included in citywide, borough, and district counts but removed from school-level files.\nAttendance is attributed to the school the student attended at the time. If a student attends multiple schools in a school year, the student will contribute data towards multiple schools.\nStarting in 2020-21, the NYC DOE transitioned to NYSED's definition of chronic absenteeism. Students are considered chronically absent if they have an attendance of 90 percent or less (i.e. students who are absent 10 percent or more of the total days). In order to be included in chronic absenteeism calculations, students must be enrolled for at least 10 days (regardless of whether present or absent) and must have been present for at least 1 day. The NYSED chronic absenteeism definition is applied to all prior years in the report.\nSchool-level chronic absenteeism data reflect chronic absenteeism at a particular school. In order to eliminate double-counting students in chronic absenteeism counts, calculations at the district, borough, and citywide levels include all attendance data that contribute to the given geographic category. For example, if a student was chronically absent at one school but not at another, the student would only be counted once in the citywide calculation. For this reason, chronic absenteeism counts will not align across files.\nAll demographic data are based on a student's most recent record in a given year.\nStudents With Disabilities (SWD) data do not include Pre-K students since Pre-K students are screened for IEPs only at the parents' request.\nEnglish language learner (ELL) data do not include Pre-K students since the New York State Education Department only begins administering assessments to be identified as an ELL in Kindergarten.\nOnly grades PK-12 are shown, but calculations for \"All Grades\" also include students missing a grade level, so PK-12 may not add up to \"All Grades\". \nData include students missing a gender, but are not shown due to small cell counts.\nData for Asian students include Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islanders\u00a0. Multi-racial and Native American students, as well as students missing ethnicity/race data are included in the \"Other\" ethnicity category.\nIn order to comply with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) regulations on public reporting of education outcomes, rows with five or fewer students are suppressed, and have been replaced with an \"s\". Using total days of attendance as a proxy\u00a0, rows with 900 or fewer total days are suppressed. In addition, other rows have been replaced with an \"s\" when they could reveal, through addition or subtraction, the underlying numbers that have been redacted. Chronic absenteeism values are suppressed, regardless of total days, if the number of students who contribute\u00a0 at least 20 days is five or fewer.\u00a0\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting shift to remote learning in March 2020, 2019-20 attendance data was only available for September 2019 through March 13, 2020. Interactions data from the spring of 2020 are reported on a separate tab.\nInteractions were reported by schools during remote learning, from April 6 2020 through June 26 2020 (a total of 57 instructional days, excluding special professional development days of June 4 and June 9). Schools were required to indicate any student from their roster that did not have an interaction on a given day. Schools were able to define interactions in a way that made sense for their students and families. Definitions of an interaction included:\n\u2022 Student submission of an assignment or completion of an assessment, in whichever manner the school is collecting\n\u2022 Student participation in an online forum, chat log, or discussion thread\n\u2022 Student/family phone call, email or response to teacher email\n\u2022 Phone, email, and/or other digital communication with a family member which confirms student interaction/engagement\n\u2022 Other evidence of participation as determined by the principal.\nInteractions data are attributed to students' school of record on a given day. A student participating in a Shared Instruction (SHIN) model may have recorded interactions at multiple schools on a given day, but only one record is counted for the interaction rate, attributed to students' school of record for that day.\nDue to the shift to hybrid learning, attendance data for the 2020-21 school year include both in-person and remote instruction. Total days, days absent, and days present fields include both in-person and remote attendance.\nMore information on attendance policies can be found here: https://www.schools.nyc.gov/school-life/rules-for-students/attendance\u00a0",

The 2023 Study determined the waste composition of several major sources from which DSNY collects: residential households, New York City Public Schools, the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA), and on-street litter baskets. Waste from these generators was categorized into 96 main material categories. In addition to the 96 sort categories, certain material groups were further subsorted into 826 subsort categories which are provided in this dataset by residential strata and time period. Because not all the main material categories were subsorted, there are two separate datasets \u2014 one for the main sort results and one for the subsort results. Results for both datasets are presented in absolute terms as the quantity by weight of each material type, per stream. The quantity of each material is calculated by applying the percent composition to the total quantity of specified DSNY collections.",

        "description": "The Resiliency Exposure Forecast for Outdoor Heat serves as an effort to evaluate the scope of planned adaption initiatives and their potential to reduce exposure to increasing temperatures in future decades. The Outdoor Heat Forecast projects temperatures across city neighborhoods using an urban heat flux model. This is broken into two main subsections: 1) a Control Scenario to determine future neighborhood-level temperature in the absence of new adaptation interventions and progress, and 2) a Planned Action Scenario to determine how tree canopy expansion could change heat profiles compared to the Control Scenario. This dataset defines the Planned Actions as tree canopy growth being maintained across jurisdictions, which requires efforts by private and public landowners, and being expanded through the NYC Parks Department\u2019s Neighborhood Tree Planting Program. This is based on data from the Neighborhood Tree Planting Program plans, Land Cover raster data from the city's Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) assessments, and the Surface Urban Energy and Water Balance Scheme (SUEWS) tool. Temperature projections should only be compared to the baseline for this exercise, and not other models, as they hold separate assumptions that this evaluation may not account for. The overarching measure is the amount of extreme heat by the 2050s that is managed by projected tree canopy expansion. \n\nFor more information on the components of the data set, please visit OMB's Technical Appendix for the FY 2026 Climate Budgeting Publication. https://www.nyc.gov/assets/omb/downloads/pdf/exec25/exec25-nyccbta.pdf",

        "description": "This dataset contains information on antibody testing for COVID-19: the number of people who received a test, the number of people with positive results, the percentage of people tested who tested positive, and the rate of testing per 100,000 people, stratified by week of testing. </br> These data can also be accessed here: https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data/blob/master/trends/antibody-by-week.csv  \r\n\r\n\r\nExposure to COVID-19 can be detected by measuring antibodies to the disease in a person\u2019s blood, which can indicate that a person may have had an immune response to the virus. Antibodies are proteins produced by the body\u2019s immune system that can be found in the blood. People can test positive for antibodies after they have been exposed, sometimes when they no longer test positive for the virus itself. It is important to note that the science around COVID-19 antibody tests is evolving rapidly and there is still much uncertainty about what individual antibody test results mean for a single person and what population-level antibody test results mean for understanding the epidemiology of COVID-19 at a population level. These data only provide information on people tested. People receiving an antibody test do not reflect all people in New York City;  therefore, these data may not reflect antibody prevalence among all New Yorkers. Increasing instances of screening programs further impact the generalizability of these data, as screening programs influence who and how many people are tested over time. Examples of screening programs in NYC include: employers screening their workers (e.g., hospitals), and long-term care facilities screening their residents.\r\n\r\nIn addition, there may be potential biases toward people receiving an antibody test who have a positive result because people who were previously ill are preferentially seeking testing, in addition to the testing of persons with higher exposure (e.g., health care workers, first responders.)\r\n\r\nRates were calculated using interpolated intercensal population estimates updated in 2019. These rates differ from previously reported rates based on the 2000 Census or previous versions of population estimates. The Health Department produced these population estimates based on estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau and NYC Department of City Planning. \r\n\r\nAntibody tests are categorized based on the date of specimen collection and are aggregated by full weeks starting each Sunday and ending on Saturday. For example, a person whose blood was collected for antibody testing on Wednesday, May 6 would be categorized as tested during the week ending May 9. A person tested twice in one week would only be counted once in that week. This dataset includes testing data beginning April 5, 2020.\r\n\r\nData are updated daily, and the dataset preserves historical records and source data changes, so each extract date reflects the current copy of the data as of that date. For example, an extract date of 11/04/2020 and extract date of 11/03/2020 will both contain all records as they were as of that extract date. Without filtering or grouping by extract date, an analysis will almost certainly be miscalculating or counting the same values multiple times. To analyze the most current data, only use the latest extract date. Antibody tests that are missing dates are not included in the dataset; as dates are identified, these events are added.   Lags between occurrence and report of cases and tests can be assessed by comparing counts and rates across multiple data extract dates.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor further details, visit:\r\n\u2022\thttps://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page\r\n\u2022\thttps://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data",

        "description": "Overall attendance data include students in Districts 1-32 and 75 (Special Education). Students in District 79 (Alternative Schools & Programs), charter schools, home schooling, and home and hospital instruction are excluded. Pre-K data do not include NYC Early Education Centers or District Pre-K Centers; therefore, Pre-K data are limited to those who attend K-12 schools that offer Pre-K. Transfer schools are included in citywide, borough, and district counts but removed from school-level files.\nAttendance is attributed to the school the student attended at the time. If a student attends multiple schools in a school year, the student will contribute data towards multiple schools.\nStarting in 2020-21, the NYC DOE transitioned to NYSED's definition of chronic absenteeism. Students are considered chronically absent if they have an attendance of 90 percent or less (i.e. students who are absent 10 percent or more of the total days). In order to be included in chronic absenteeism calculations, students must be enrolled for at least 10 days (regardless of whether present or absent) and must have been present for at least 1 day. The NYSED chronic absenteeism definition is applied to all prior years in the report.\nSchool-level chronic absenteeism data reflect chronic absenteeism at a particular school. In order to eliminate double-counting students in chronic absenteeism counts, calculations at the district, borough, and citywide levels include all attendance data that contribute to the given geographic category. For example, if a student was chronically absent at one school but not at another, the student would only be counted once in the citywide calculation. For this reason, chronic absenteeism counts will not align across files.\nAll demographic data are based on a student's most recent record in a given year.\nStudents With Disabilities (SWD) data do not include Pre-K students since Pre-K students are screened for IEPs only at the parents' request.\nEnglish language learner (ELL) data do not include Pre-K students since the New York State Education Department only begins administering assessments to be identified as an ELL in Kindergarten.\nOnly grades PK-12 are shown, but calculations for \"All Grades\" also include students missing a grade level, so PK-12 may not add up to \"All Grades\". \nData include students missing a gender, but are not shown due to small cell counts.\nData for Asian students include Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islanders\u00a0. Multi-racial and Native American students, as well as students missing ethnicity/race data are included in the \"Other\" ethnicity category.\nIn order to comply with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) regulations on public reporting of education outcomes, rows with five or fewer students are suppressed, and have been replaced with an \"s\". Using total days of attendance as a proxy\u00a0, rows with 900 or fewer total days are suppressed. In addition, other rows have been replaced with an \"s\" when they could reveal, through addition or subtraction, the underlying numbers that have been redacted. Chronic absenteeism values are suppressed, regardless of total days, if the number of students who contribute\u00a0 at least 20 days is five or fewer.\u00a0\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting shift to remote learning in March 2020, 2019-20 attendance data was only available for September 2019 through March 13, 2020. Interactions data from the spring of 2020 are reported on a separate tab.\nInteractions were reported by schools during remote learning, from April 6 2020 through June 26 2020 (a total of 57 instructional days, excluding special professional development days of June 4 and June 9). Schools were required to indicate any student from their roster that did not have an interaction on a given day. Schools were able to define interactions in a way that made sense for their students and families. Definitions of an interaction included:\n\u2022 Student submission of an assignment or completion of an assessment, in whichever manner the school is collecting\n\u2022 Student participation in an online forum, chat log, or discussion thread\n\u2022 Student/family phone call, email or response to teacher email\n\u2022 Phone, email, and/or other digital communication with a family member which confirms student interaction/engagement\n\u2022 Other evidence of participation as determined by the principal.\nInteractions data are attributed to students' school of record on a given day. A student participating in a Shared Instruction (SHIN) model may have recorded interactions at multiple schools on a given day, but only one record is counted for the interaction rate, attributed to students' school of record for that day.\nDue to the shift to hybrid learning, attendance data for the 2020-21 school year include both in-person and remote instruction. Total days, days absent, and days present fields include both in-person and remote attendance.\nMore information on attendance policies can be found here: https://www.schools.nyc.gov/school-life/rules-for-students/attendance\u00a0",

        "description": "This dataset contains information on antibody testing for COVID-19: the number of people who received a test, the number of people with positive results, the percentage of people tested who tested positive, and the rate of testing per 100,000 people, stratified by ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) neighborhood poverty group. These data can also be accessed here: https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data/blob/master/totals/antibody-by-poverty.csv \n\n\nExposure to COVID-19 can be detected by measuring antibodies to the disease in a person\u2019s blood, which can indicate that a person may have had an immune response to the virus. Antibodies are proteins produced by the body\u2019s immune system that can be found in the blood. People can test positive for antibodies after they have been exposed, sometimes when they no longer test positive for the virus itself. It is important to note that the science around COVID-19 antibody tests is evolving rapidly and there is still much uncertainty about what individual antibody test results mean for a single person and what population-level antibody test results mean for understanding the epidemiology of COVID-19 at a population level.\n\nThese data only provide information on people tested. People receiving an antibody test do not reflect all people in New York City; therefore, these data may not reflect antibody prevalence among all New Yorkers. Increasing instances of screening programs further impact the generalizability of these data, as screening programs influence who and how many people are tested over time. Examples of screening programs in NYC include: employers screening their workers (e.g., hospitals), and long-term care facilities screening their residents.\n\nIn addition, there may be potential biases toward people receiving an antibody test who have a positive result because people who were previously ill are preferentially seeking testing, in addition to the testing of persons with higher exposure (e.g., health care workers, first responders.)\n\nNeighborhood-level poverty groups were classified in a manner consistent with Health Department practices to describe and monitor disparities in health in NYC. Neighborhood poverty measures are defined as the percentage of people earning below the Federal Poverty Threshold (FPT) within a ZCTA. The standard cut-points for defining categories of neighborhood-level poverty in NYC are:\n\u2022\tLow: <10% of residents in ZCTA living below the FPT\n\u2022\tMedium: 10% to <20%\n\u2022\tHigh: 20% to <30%\n\u2022\tVery high: \u226530% residents living below the FPT\nThe ZCTAs used for classification reflect the first non-missing address within NYC for each person reported with an antibody test result.\n\nRates were calculated using interpolated intercensal population estimates updated in 2019. These rates differ from previously reported rates based on the 2000 Census or previous versions of population estimates. The Health Department produced these population estimates based on estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau and NYC Department of City Planning. Rates for poverty were calculated using direct standardization for age at diagnosis and weighting by the US 2000 standard population.\nAntibody tests are categorized based on the date of specimen collection and are aggregated by full weeks starting each Sunday and ending on Saturday. For example, a person whose blood was collected for antibody testing on Wednesday, May 6 would be categorized as tested during the week ending May 9. A person tested twice in one week would only be counted once in that week. This dataset includes testing data beginning April 5, 2020.\n\nData are updated daily, and the dataset preserves historical records and source data changes, so each extract date reflects the current copy of the data as of that date. For example, an extract date of 11/04/2020 and extract date of 11/03/2020 will both contain all records as they were as of that extract date. Without filtering or grouping by extract date, an analysis will almost certainly be miscalculating or counting the same values multiple times. To analyze the most current data, only use the latest extract date. Antibody tests that are missing dates are not included in the dataset; as dates are identified, these events are added.   Lags between occurrence and report of cases and tests can be assessed by comparing counts and rates across multiple data extract dates.\n\n\nFor further details, visit:\n\u2022\thttps://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page\n\u2022\thttps://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data\n\u2022\thttps://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/Modified-Zip-Code-Tabulation-Areas-MODZCTA-/pri4-ifjk",

NYC, a Citywide plan to increase the amount of cooling features available to the public during heat emergencies, particularly in neighborhoods that face the dangers of high heat. This is part of the Cool It! NYC 2020 Data Collection, which includes the following amenities:\r\n  \r\nDrinking Fountains: Indicates whether a drinking fountain is activated, not yet activated, broken, or under construction. \r\n\r\nSpray Showers: Indicates whether a spray shower installed before July 2020 is activated, not yet activated, broken, or under construction. At this time, spray showers are mapped to the middle of parks. \r\n \r\nCooling Sites: To measure neighborhoods that are the most at risk during extreme heat, NYC Health and Columbia University developed the New York City Heat Vulnerability Index, or HVI. Parks used this data to direct new cooling elements to neighborhoods with HVIs of 4 and 5.\r\n \r\nData Dictionary: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GpXHX9p0e520LcAf3gstOKTQm64wxkdDUiACjhMwd9Q/edit?usp=sharing",

These tables are aggregated from the DCP Housing Database, which is derived from Department of Buildings (DOB)-approved housing construction and demolition jobs filed or completed in NYC since January 1, 2010. Net housing unit change is calculated as the sum of all three construction job types that add or remove residential units: new buildings, major alterations, and demolitions, and can be used to determine the change in legal housing units across time and space.\nAll previously released versions of this data are available on the <a href=\"https://www.nyc.gov/content/planning/pages/resources/datasets/housing-unit-change-summary\">DCP Website: BYTES of the BIG APPLE</a>.

'Dewatered solids' are the solids remaining in digested sludge after removal of water in a dewatering facility. 'Biosolids', per the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), is treated sewage sludge that meets the EPA pollutant, pathogen & vector attraction requirements for land application and surface disposal, and the DEP has certified it with the EPA as such. \n\nBiosolids in this case are also dewatered. Depending on the material being managed (i.e., dewatered solids or biosolids), a 'management practice site' may be one of the following: 1) a third party vendor treatment facility (e.g., composting, dryer, alkaline treatment) that converts the dewatered solids into biosolids for beneficial reuse in various land application practices (e.g., agricultural land application, reclamation site application) or for distribution/marketing as a soil amendment or fertilizer; 2) a direct  land application site for agricultural use (typically a farm); or 3) a landfill. The dataset includes the pathogen (disease-causing organism) reduction and vector (an animal capable of transmitting disease such as flies or rodents) attraction reduction options employed as part of the treatment and the type of biosolids class produced, if applicable. There are different biosolids class types, each having specified treatment requirements for pollutants, pathogens and vector attraction reduction, as well as general requirements and management practices,  \n\nFor more information regarding biosolids compliance, treatment, uses and class types please refer to: <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/biosolids\">https://www.epa.gov/biosolids</a>.",

        "description": "<p style=\"padding-bottom:10px\"> The report contains thirteen (13) performance metrics for City's workforce development programs. Each metric can be breakdown by three demographic types (gender, race/ethnicity, and age group) and the program target population (e.g., youth and young adults, NYCHA communities) as well.</p>\n\n<p style=\"padding-bottom:10px\">This report is a key output of an integrated data system that collects, integrates, and generates disaggregated data by Mayor's Office for Economic Opportunity (NYC Opportunity). Currently, the report is generated by the integrated database incorporating data from 18 workforce development programs managed by 5 City agencies.</p>\n\n<p style=\"padding-bottom:10px\">There has been no single \"workforce development system\" in the City of New York. Instead, many discrete public agencies directly manage or fund local partners to deliver a range of different services, sometimes tailored to specific populations. As a result, program data have historically been fragmented as well, making it challenging to develop insights based on a comprehensive picture. To overcome it, NYC Opportunity collects data from 5 City agencies and builds the integrated database, and it begins to build a complete picture of how participants move through the system onto a career pathway.</p>\n\n<p style=\"padding-bottom:10px\">Each row represents a count of unique individuals for a specific performance metric, program target population, a specific demographic group, and a specific period. For example, if the Metric Value is 2000 with Clients Served (Metric Name), NYCHA Communities (Program Target Population), Asian (Subgroup), and 2019 (Period), you can say that \"In 2019, 2,000 Asian individuals participated programs targeting NYCHA communities. </p>\n\n<p style=\"padding-bottom:10px\">Please refer to the Workforce Data Portal for further data guidance (https://workforcedata.nyc.gov/en/data-guidance), and interactive visualizations for this report (https://workforcedata.nyc.gov/en/common-metrics).</p>",

The data has been modified to ensure that if 50% or more of a tax lot is within a Walk to a Park Service area, then the entire lot is shown as served.\r\n\r\nNew York City, as part of the OneNYC 2050 Building a Strong and Fair City plan, has put forth a goal of 85 percent of New York City residents living within a walking distance of a park by 2030. The Walk to a Park initiative focuses on increasing access to parks and open spaces, concentrating on areas of the city that are under-resourced and where residents are living further than a walk to a park. NYC Parks calculates the number of New Yorkers within walking distance of a park and reports on this as part of the Mayor\u2019s Management Report. \u201cWalking distance\u201d is defined as a 1/4-mile or less for sites such as small playgrounds and sitting areas; or a 1/2-mile or less for larger parks that serve a wider region, typically over 6 acres or with access to recreation center. Certain properties in NYC Parks' portfolio, such as cemeteries, community gardens, or sites with no recreational equipment were not included in this analysis. Similarly, some publicly accessible parks and open-space amenities not under the jurisdiction of NYC Parks were included in this analysis, as they provide recreational value.\r\n\r\nThis information is periodically updated and is only current as of the last publication date. The analysis is performed in part using secondary data. Data accuracy is limited by the scale and accuracy of the original sources.

The figures in the table have been adjusted to reflect debt service that was originally scheduled for payment in each year since 2000.</br>\n\n(2) New York City is required to have a balanced annual budget. In years when it runs a surplus, the primary means the city uses to comply with this requirement is to use up some or all of the surplus by prepaying some of the subsequent years' debt service expenses. As a result, the cash outlay for debt service in a given year is not an accurate representation of the true cost of debt service in that year.</br>\n\n(3) The defeasance of $536 million of GO bonds in 2007 reduced debt service in 2008, 2009, and 2010. Debt service in the table is presented as if the defeasance had not occurred.</br>\n\n(4) The defeasance of $1.986 billion of GO bonds in 2008 reduced debt service in 2010. Debt service in the table is presented as if the defeasance had not occurred.</br>\n\n(5) The defeasance of $718 million of TFA bonds in 2007 reduced debt service in 2008, 2009, and 2010. Debt service in the table is presented as if the defeasance had not occurred.</br>\n\n(6) The defeasance of $196 million of TFA bonds in 2013 reduced debt service in 2014, 2015, and 2016. Debt service in the table is presented as if the defeasance had not occurred.</br>\n\n(7) The defeasance of $637 million of TFA bonds in 2015 with savings from Sales Tax Asset Receivable Corporation (STAR) reduced debt service in 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018. Debt service in the table is presented as if the defeasance had not occurred.</br>\n\n(8) The defeasance of $65 million of Jay Street Development Corporation (JSDC) bonds in 2007 reduced debt service in 2009 and 2010. Debt service in the table is presented as if the defeasance had not occurred.</br>\n\n(9) TFA BARBs and TSASC are not included in OMB's or the Comptroller's definitions of New York City outstanding debt. For an explanation of these items, and their inclusion in NYC IBO's definition of New York City outstanding debt, please see New Outstanding Debt.</br>\n\n(10) In 2006, TSASC restructured its outstanding indebtedness. This included a one time expense of $161 million for redeeming all bonds issued under a secured loan agreement with the United States Department of Transportation, via the department's Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) program. Additionally, all prior year TSASC bond series were defeased, leaving only series 2006-1 bonds outstanding. </br>",

WPP provides wage reimbursements for nonprofits to provide subsidized jobs to their existing program participants. WPP supports providers that prioritize recruitment of NYCHA youth.

First Session is from 11:00am - 3:00pm. Second Session is from 4:00pm - 7:00pm, with the requirement for Olympic / Intermediate pools to stay open for Extended Second Session from 7:00pm - 8:00pm when the City Heat Emergency Plan is activated.\n\nFor each pool season, every pool will have at least two survey submissions per day - one submission for the first session, and one submission for the second session. A pool will have a third submission if it stays open for an extended second session.\n\nData Dictionary: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15lHSZF76W1cZnjwlWRSn7tzLh6EqVZVeZ2vwDFqXHMM/edit?usp=sharing\n\nFor reference, pool geography from Open Data can be found here: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Pools/3vjv-6tf5",

NYC School Survey results contribute 10% - 15% of a school's Progress Report grade (the exact contribution to the Progress Report is dependant on school type). Survey questions assess the community's opinions on academic expectations, communication, engagement, and safety and respect. School leaders can use survey results to better understand their own school's strengths and target areas for improvement. \n\nThe NYC School Survey helps school leaders understand what key members of the school community say about the learning environment at each school. The information captured by the survey is designed to support a dialogue among all members of the school community about how to make the school a better place to learn.",

        "description": "The Resiliency Exposure Forecast for Coastal Flooding serves as an effort to evaluate the scope of planned adaption initiatives and their potential to reduce exposure to storm-surge and tidal flooding in future decades. The Coastal Flood Forecast describes the amount of buildings at risk (buildings in areas likely to flood) using spatial analysis. This is broken into two main subsections: 1) a Control Scenario to determine how many buildings will be at risk of flooding in the absence of large-scale coastal flood protection projects at points in the future, and 2) a Planned Action Scenario that to determine how many buildings will no longer be at risk (and how many will remain at risk) if planned infrastructure projects are built. This dataset defines the Planned Action as select neighborhood-scale coastal flood protection projects. These are typically projects that create stationary or deplorable barriers to protect areas upland of barriers that stop flood waters from coming onto land. They can include methods such as levees, berms and floodwalls. When these projects are constructed with the intent to protect a flood hazard area behind them rather than just a specific asset, this dataset will consider them neighborhood-scale. Neighborhoods are assessed for their risk to the 100-year floodplain and high-tide flooding areas.\nFor more information on the components of the data set, please visit OMB's Technical Appendix for the FY 2026 Climate Budgeting Publication. https://www.nyc.gov/assets/omb/downloads/pdf/exec25/exec25-nyccbta.pdf",

Sub-sorting of an additional 172 categories was conducted to get a more detailed understanding of the wide variety of plastic products in the waste stream, as well as a sub-set of Paper products. Results are presented in absolute terms as the quantity by weight of each material type. The quantity of each material is calculated by applying the percent composition to the total quantity of DSNY collections for fiscal year 2017 (July 2016-June 2017).",

Natural turf is any lawn area consisting of non-synthetic grass that must be mowed on a regular basis. A park or park zone that includes sites with lawn areas large enough to require the use of mowing equipment is considered a 'turf site'. There can be multiple turf sites within a given park. There are three types of maintenance done at these sites: lawn mowing, trimming lawn edges, and blowing away clippings and debris that occurred during the mowing and trimming.\n\nAt the start of each day, crews receive an assignment designating which sites to visit and what work needs to be done at that site (in the data, this assignment is referred to as the \"\"assigned tasks\"\"). \n\nAt the conclusion of each site visit, a staff member is responsible for completing a survey that confirms what work was and was not completed. This data set is the compilation of those survey responses.\n\nExplore the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lwC4CSKo7OSITA8K-l6onyfq_MP_psIb44fdBRfPbps/edit?usp=sharing\">Data Dictionary</a>",

The survey ranks among the largest surveys of any kind ever conducted nationally. Survey results provide insight into a school's learning environment and contribute a measure of diversification that goes beyond test scores on the Progress Report. NYC School Survey results contribute 10% - 15% of a school's Progress Report grade (the exact contribution to the Progress Report is dependent on school type). Survey questions assess the community's opinions on academic expectations, communication, engagement, and safety and respect. School leaders can use survey results to better understand their own school's strengths and target areas for improvement. The NYC School Survey helps school leaders understand what key members of the school community say about the learning environment at each school. The information captured by the survey is designed to support a dialogue among all members of the school community about how to make the school a better place to learn.",

It is important to note that schools self-report their scheduling information in STARS. The report also includes information regarding the number and ratio of certified physical education instructors and designated physical education instructional space.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis report consists of six tabs:\r\n\r\n\r\n1.    PE Instruction Borough-Level\r\n2.    PE Instruction District-Level\r\n3.    PE Instruction School-Level\r\n4.    Certified PE Teachers\r\n5.    PE Space\r\n6. Supplemental Programs\r\n\r\n\r\n1. PE Instruction Borough-Level\r\n\r\nThis tab includes the average frequency and average total minutes per week of physical education by borough, disaggregated by grade, race and ethnicity, gender, special education status and English language learner status. This report only includes students who were enrolled in the same school across all academic terms in the 2015-16 school year. Data on students with disabilities and English language learners are as of the end of the 2015-16 school year. Data on adaptive PE is based on individualized education programs (IEP) finalized on or before 05/31/2016.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. PE Instruction District-Level\r\n\r\nThis tab includes the average frequency and average total minutes per week of physical education by district, disaggregated by grade, race and ethnicity, gender, special education status and English language learner status. This report only includes students who were enrolled in the same school across all academic terms in the 2015-16 school year. Data on students with disabilities and English language learners are as of the end of the 2015-16 school year. Data on adaptive PE is based on individualized education programs (IEP) finalized on or before 05/31/2016.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. PE Instruction School-Level\r\n\r\nThis tab includes the average frequency and average total minutes per week of physical education by school, disaggregated by grade, race and ethnicity, gender, special education status and English language learner status. This report only includes students who were enrolled in the same school across all academic terms in the 2015-16 school year. Data on students with disabilities and English language learners are as of the end of the 2015-16 school year. Data on adaptive PE is based on individualized education programs (IEP) finalized on or before 05/31/2016.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Certified PE Teachers\r\n\r\nThis tab provides the number of designated full-time and part-time physical education certified instructors. Does not include elementary, early childhood and K-8 physical education teachers that provide physical education instruction under a common branches license. Also includes ratio of full time instructors teaching in a physical education license to students by school. Data reported is for the 2015-2016 school year as of 10/31/2015.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. PE Space\r\n\r\nThis tab provides information on all designated indoor, outdoor and off-site spaces used by the school for physical education as reported through the Principal Annual Space Survey and the Outdoor Yard Report. It is important to note that information on each room category is self-reported by principals, and principals determine how each room is classified. Data captures if the PE space is co-located, used by another school or used for another purpose. Includes gyms, athletic fields, auxiliary exercise spaces, dance rooms, field houses, multipurpose spaces, outdoor yards, off-site locations, playrooms, swimming pools and weight rooms as designated PE Space.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. Supplemental Programs\r\n\r\nThis tab provides information on the department's supplemental physical education program and a list of schools that use it.I. Includes all Move-to-Improve (MTI) supplemental programs for the 2015-2016 school year.\r\n\r\n\r\nLink to NY State PE Regulations: http://www.p12.nysed.gov/ciai/pe/documents/title8part135.pdf\r\n\r\n\r\nAny questions regarding this report should be directed to:\r\nNnennaya Okezie, Executive Director\r\nNYC Department of Education, Office of Intergovernmental Affairs\r\nPhone: 212-374-4947\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIdiosyncrasies or limitations of the data to be aware of: \r\n\r\n12,085 students (5.96% of the 10th-12th grade base student population in our analysis) were permitted a substitution by the department in the 2015-16 school year.\r\n\r\nAdditional Information:\r\n\"Move-to-Improve (MTI)\r\n\r\nThe MTI K-5 physical activity program is designed to create and support an active learning environment in the classroom and school community. MTI activities blend academics and physical activity into educational lessons that support New York State PE Learning Standards and are integrated with Common Core Learning Standards.\r\n\r\nThe MTI program is free and includes benefits and incentives for students, teachers, principals, and schools.\r\nMTI activities are inclusive and designed to enhance academic learning during classroom instruction.\r\nA growing body of research suggests that student success depends on a combination of academic skills, healthy lifestyle, and physical and mental fitness. Specifically, in NYC, the correlation between fitness levels and academic achievement has been shown:\r\nhttp://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/downloads/pdf/survey/survey-2009fitnessgram.pdf\r\n\r\nMTI All-Star school\r\n\r\nSchools with a comprehensive PE program, led by a certified or designated PE teacher, have the opportunity to become an MTI All-Star school by training at least 85% of their eligible teachers in MTI.\r\n\r\nNew York State requires all elementary schools to provide at least 120 minutes of PE every week for all students. MTI All-Star schools can use MTI activities during classroom instructional time to supplement their existing PE program to meet this requirement.\r\n\r\nMTI All-Star schools receive MTI implementation guidance and Citywide recognition of MTI best practices\r\n\r\nAll NYC district public schools with classroom teachers serving grades K-5 are eligible to participate in the MTI program.\r\n\r\nFor the 2016-2017 school year, elementary schools can participate in MTI in two ways:\r\n\r\n1) MTI Train-the-Trainer\r\n\r\n- Certified or designated PE teachers from district public elementary schools can attend an MTI Train-the-Trainer (TTT) session where they will learn to become MTI trainers for their school.\r\n\r\n- TTT sessions are offered during school hours so PE teachers will need to be released to attend.\r\n\r\n2) MTI Event\r\n\r\n- K-5 classroom teachers (including cluster, PE, and special education) from district public schools can register for an open MTI workshop session offered citywide.\r\n\r\n- Participating teachers receive UFT negotiated training rate (for after-school hours) and a certificate of completion (can count towards the 175 hours of professional development; contingent on principal\u2019s approval).\"",

Schools are only compared to other schools in the same School Level (e.g., Elementary, K-8, Middle, High)\r\n\r\n1) Elementary & K-8 - peer index is a value from 0-100.  We use a composite demographic statistic based on % ELL, % SpEd, % Title I free lunch, and % Black/Hispanic.  Higher values indicate student populations with higher need\r\n\r\n2) Middle & High - peer index is a value from 1.00-4.50.  For middle schools, we use the average 4th grade proficiency ratings in ELA and Math for all their students that have 4th grade test scores.  For high schools, we use the average 8th grade proficiency ratings in ELA and Math for all their students that have 8th grade test scores.  Lower values indicate student populations with higher need\r\n\r\n3) D84 / Charter Schools - the overall score does not include the results of the learning environment survey. \r\n\r\n4) Schools for Transfer Students - consists of schools with large populations of high school students transferring from NYC High Schools or from out of state/country.  No peer index value is assigned because this set of schools is its own peer group. The reports contain 3 categories with one additional credit section.  Unlike the HS Progress Report, the Environment Category is only composed of Survey Results.  Performance measures 6-year graduation rate and Progress captures student level improvements in attendance, credit accumulation and Regents passed.  The additional credit section rewards schools demonstrating exceptional achievement (11 credits or more earned per year) among overage/under-credit populations.",

Importantly, Early RAPP works to create a school culture that supports those respectful relationships, and creates safe spaces for young people to seek help for themselves and their peers. Community Educators facilitate interactive workshops for students, parents, and community members, as well as trainings to school staff.\r\nThe Early RAPP aims to improve student knowledge and understanding of the types of abuse and healthy relationships. In order to measure the changes in knowledge and attitudes resulting from their workshops and trainings, Community Educators conduct surveys before and after workshops. Every school year, Community Educators are required to conduct at least three workshops in the fall semester and at least three workshops in the spring semester, in which pre- and post-workshop surveys are conducted. Participant responses are anonymous. The Early RAPP pre- and post-workshop surveys are identical, consisting of fourteen standard questions about teen dating violence and healthy relationships with response options: Agree/Disagree (10 questions) and Healthy/Not Sure/Unhealthy (4 questions). The questions aim to measure each participant\u2019s understanding of the topics covered in the workshop. This report provides a summary of pooled results from 1,325 pre- surveys and 1,093 post- surveys from workshops conducted with middle school students between January 30, 2019 and January 21, 2021.",

There are many factors that contribute to a location's resiliency to various threats - this analysis takes a holistic view, combining and analyzing datasets to compare and contrast strategies to become more resilient to the threats of outdoor heat, indoor heat, and coastal flooding. Higher scores indicate greater adaptation levels, and each neighborhood's score is relative to other neighborhoods; a neighborhood with the highest score is assessed to have the greatest relative level of adaptation measures, but overall adaptation can always be improved. This tool was developed to provide a unified way to view levels of adaptive capacity across locations, specifically neighborhoods (NTAs). OMB developed this baseline inventory of the city's existing resiliency measures based on a suite of relevant metrics, or Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). More than 30 unique KPIs are grouped into Categories, which represent adaptation strategies. The Inventory does not replace or conflict with existing efforts or data. It seeks to measure factors and efforts that reduce exposure (increase adaptive capacity) to climate threats, which would leave fewer people, areas, or assets at risk despite varying levels of threat and vulnerability.",

It is important to note that schools self-report their scheduling information in STARS. The report also includes information regarding the number and ratio of certified physical education instructors and designated physical education instructional space.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis report consists of six tabs:\r\n\r\n\r\n1.    PE Instruction Borough-Level\r\n2.    PE Instruction District-Level\r\n3.    PE Instruction School-Level\r\n4.    Certified PE Teachers\r\n5.    PE Space\r\n6. Supplemental Programs\r\n\r\n\r\n1. PE Instruction Borough-Level\r\n\r\nThis tab includes the average frequency and average total minutes per week of physical education by borough, disaggregated by grade, race and ethnicity, gender, special education status and English language learner status. This report only includes students who were enrolled in the same school across all academic terms in the 2015-16 school year. Data on students with disabilities and English language learners are as of the end of the 2015-16 school year. Data on adaptive PE is based on individualized education programs (IEP) finalized on or before 05/31/2016.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. PE Instruction District-Level\r\n\r\nThis tab includes the average frequency and average total minutes per week of physical education by district, disaggregated by grade, race and ethnicity, gender, special education status and English language learner status. This report only includes students who were enrolled in the same school across all academic terms in the 2015-16 school year. Data on students with disabilities and English language learners are as of the end of the 2015-16 school year. Data on adaptive PE is based on individualized education programs (IEP) finalized on or before 05/31/2016.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. PE Instruction School-Level\r\n\r\nThis tab includes the average frequency and average total minutes per week of physical education by school, disaggregated by grade, race and ethnicity, gender, special education status and English language learner status. This report only includes students who were enrolled in the same school across all academic terms in the 2015-16 school year. Data on students with disabilities and English language learners are as of the end of the 2015-16 school year. Data on adaptive PE is based on individualized education programs (IEP) finalized on or before 05/31/2016.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Certified PE Teachers\r\n\r\nThis tab provides the number of designated full-time and part-time physical education certified instructors. Does not include elementary, early childhood and K-8 physical education teachers that provide physical education instruction under a common branches license. Also includes ratio of full time instructors teaching in a physical education license to students by school. Data reported is for the 2015-2016 school year as of 10/31/2015.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. PE Space\r\n\r\nThis tab provides information on all designated indoor, outdoor and off-site spaces used by the school for physical education as reported through the Principal Annual Space Survey and the Outdoor Yard Report. It is important to note that information on each room category is self-reported by principals, and principals determine how each room is classified. Data captures if the PE space is co-located, used by another school or used for another purpose. Includes gyms, athletic fields, auxiliary exercise spaces, dance rooms, field houses, multipurpose spaces, outdoor yards, off-site locations, playrooms, swimming pools and weight rooms as designated PE Space.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. Supplemental Programs\r\n\r\nThis tab provides information on the department's supplemental physical education program and a list of schools that use it.I. Includes all Move-to-Improve (MTI) supplemental programs for the 2015-2016 school year.\r\n\r\n\r\nLink to NY State PE Regulations: http://www.p12.nysed.gov/ciai/pe/documents/title8part135.pdf\r\n\r\n\r\nAny questions regarding this report should be directed to:\r\nNnennaya Okezie, Executive Director\r\nNYC Department of Education, Office of Intergovernmental Affairs\r\nPhone: 212-374-4947\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIdiosyncrasies or limitations of the data to be aware of: \r\n\r\n12,085 students (5.96% of the 10th-12th grade base student population in our analysis) were permitted a substitution by the department in the 2015-16 school year.\r\n\r\nAdditional Information: \"Move-to-Improve (MTI)\r\n\r\nThe MTI K-5 physical activity program is designed to create and support an active learning environment in the classroom and school community. MTI activities blend academics and physical activity into educational lessons that support New York State PE Learning Standards and are integrated with Common Core Learning Standards.\r\n\r\nThe MTI program is free and includes benefits and incentives for students, teachers, principals, and schools.\r\nMTI activities are inclusive and designed to enhance academic learning during classroom instruction.\r\nA growing body of research suggests that student success depends on a combination of academic skills, healthy lifestyle, and physical and mental fitness. Specifically, in NYC, the correlation between fitness levels and academic achievement has been shown:\r\nhttp://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/downloads/pdf/survey/survey-2009fitnessgram.pdf\r\n\r\nMTI All-Star school\r\n\r\nSchools with a comprehensive PE program, led by a certified or designated PE teacher, have the opportunity to become an MTI All-Star school by training at least 85% of their eligible teachers in MTI.\r\n\r\nNew York State requires all elementary schools to provide at least 120 minutes of PE every week for all students. MTI All-Star schools can use MTI activities during classroom instructional time to supplement their existing PE program to meet this requirement.\r\n\r\nMTI All-Star schools receive MTI implementation guidance and Citywide recognition of MTI best practices\r\n\r\nAll NYC district public schools with classroom teachers serving grades K-5 are eligible to participate in the MTI program.\r\n\r\nFor the 2016-2017 school year, elementary schools can participate in MTI in two ways:\r\n\r\n1) MTI Train-the-Trainer\r\n\r\n- Certified or designated PE teachers from district public elementary schools can attend an MTI Train-the-Trainer (TTT) session where they will learn to become MTI trainers for their school.\r\n\r\n- TTT sessions are offered during school hours so PE teachers will need to be released to attend.\r\n\r\n2) MTI Event\r\n\r\n- K-5 classroom teachers (including cluster, PE, and special education) from district public schools can register for an open MTI workshop session offered citywide.\r\n\r\n- Participating teachers receive UFT negotiated training rate (for after-school hours) and a certificate of completion (can count towards the 175 hours of professional development; contingent on principal\u2019s approval).\"",

        "description": "This dataset contains information on antibody testing for COVID-19: the number of people who received a test, the number of people with positive results, the percentage of people tested who tested positive, and the rate of testing per 100,000 people,  stratified by sex. These data can also be accessed here: https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data/blob/master/totals/antibody-by-sex.csv    Exposure to COVID-19 can be detected by measuring antibodies to the disease in a person\u2019s blood, which can indicate that a person may have had an immune response to the virus. Antibodies are proteins produced by the body\u2019s immune system that can be found in the blood. People can test positive for antibodies after they have been exposed, sometimes when they no longer test positive for the virus itself. It is important to note that the science around COVID-19 antibody tests is evolving rapidly and there is still much uncertainty about what individual antibody test results mean for a single person and what population-level antibody test results mean for understanding the epidemiology of COVID-19 at a population level.\r\n\r\nThese data only provide information on people tested. People receiving an antibody test do not reflect all people in New York City; therefore, these data may not reflect antibody prevalence among all New Yorkers. Increasing instances of screening programs further impact the generalizability of these data, as screening programs influence who and how many people are tested over time. Examples of screening programs in NYC include: employers screening their workers (e.g., hospitals), and long-term care facilities screening their residents.\r\n\r\nIn addition, there may be potential biases toward people receiving an antibody test who have a positive result because people who were previously ill are preferentially seeking testing, in addition to the testing of persons with higher exposure (e.g., health care workers, first responders.)\r\n\r\nRates were calculated using interpolated intercensal population estimates updated in 2019. These rates differ from previously reported rates based on the 2000 Census or previous versions of population estimates. The Health Department produced these population estimates based on estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau and NYC Department of City Planning. \r\n\r\nAntibody tests are categorized based on the date of specimen collection and are aggregated by full weeks starting each Sunday and ending on Saturday. For example, a person whose blood was collected for antibody testing on Wednesday, May 6 would be categorized as tested during the week ending May 9. A person tested twice in one week would only be counted once in that week. This dataset includes testing data beginning April 5, 2020.\r\n\r\nData are updated daily, and the dataset preserves historical records and source data changes, so each extract date reflects the current copy of the data as of that date. For example, an extract date of 11/04/2020 and extract date of 11/03/2020 will both contain all records as they were as of that extract date. Without filtering or grouping by extract date, an analysis will almost certainly be miscalculating or counting the same values multiple times. To analyze the most current data, only use the latest extract date. Antibody tests that are missing dates are not included in the dataset; as dates are identified, these events are added.   Lags between occurrence and report of cases and tests can be assessed by comparing counts and rates across multiple data extract dates.\r\n\r\nFor further details, visit:\r\n\u2022\thttps://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page\r\n\u2022\thttps://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data",
